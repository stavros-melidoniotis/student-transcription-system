***Student Transcription System***

This project consists of two systems: Inner System and Outer System.

*Inner System*
 
Inner System is accessible from personel that examine student transcription requests, approve or reject them and inform students about their application's progress. This personel is
composed from professors and University's secretary.

Outer System is accessible from any individual. A student can make a transcription request by providing his personal information and uploading some official papers about economical
status, permanent residence etc. Request's examination progress can be checked at any time.
